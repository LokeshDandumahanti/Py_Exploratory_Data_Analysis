# Atliq Hotels Data Analysis (Using Pandas & Matplotlib)

Welcome to the **Atliq Hotels Data Analysis** project! This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on the hotel industry, developed as part of the Data Analyst course from Codebasics.

---

## 🚀 Overview

In this project, we dive deep into hotel operations by exploring various datasets to extract valuable insights. Through data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization, we answer key business questions such as:

- **What is the average occupancy rate per city and room category?**
- **How do revenue trends fluctuate on a monthly basis?**
- **Are bookings higher on weekends or weekdays?**
- **Which properties consistently exceed their capacity?**

Our goal is to showcase how data-driven insights can empower businesses to optimize operations, enhance customer experiences, and boost revenue.

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- **Data Import & Exploration:**  
  Imported multiple datasets including `dim_date.csv`, `dim_hotels.csv`, `dim_rooms.csv`, `Fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`, and `Fact_bookings.csv`. Conducted initial data exploration and ran ad hoc queries to understand the data.

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  Handled issues such as invalid guest entries and outlier detection in revenue data, ensuring the dataset is robust for analysis.

- **Data Transformation:**  
  Performed transformations including creating new columns (e.g., occupancy percentage), normalization, merging datasets, and aggregating insights.

- **Insights Generation:**  
  Answered critical business questions:
  - Average occupancy rate per city & room category
  - Revenue trends and monthly analysis
  - Weekend vs. weekday booking patterns
  - Identification of properties that exceed capacity

- **Visualization:**  
  Utilized **Matplotlib** (and **Pandas** plotting functions) to visualize data and communicate insights effectively.
